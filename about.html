            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <img src="_images/about_image_training.avif" alt="Training Session" class="section-img">
            <p>Empowering the Nation is a local initiative founded in 2018 by Precious Radebe with the mission to
                provide essential skills training to domestic workers and gardeners in Johannesburg. Born out of a
                desire to uplift members of her community, Precious created this initiative to help individuals, like
                her parents, who were never given the opportunity to upskill themselves. Through the training programs,
                domestic workers and gardeners are given a chance to improve their job prospects or start their own
                businesses.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <img src="_images/about_image_skill.avif" alt="Skills Training" class="section-img">
            <p>Our mission is to provide high-quality, professional training that empowers domestic workers and
                gardeners with marketable skills, allowing them to secure better employment or start their own small
                businesses. We offer a variety of six-month long Learnerships and six-week Short Skills Training
                Programmes, designed to meet the growing demand for skilled workers in households and gardens across the
                region. At Empowering the Nation, we believe that upskilling can change lives, and we are committed to
                helping every learner unlock their potential.</p>
